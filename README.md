## blackmailJS
BlackmailJS aka RansomScript is a typography class for Javascript (Vanilla). It aims to simulate character cut-outs from newspapers/magazines in the style of old-fashioned ransom notes. It concatenates a given string sequence by applying various HTML text elements like: ```<strong> <i> <em> <mark> <small> <del>``` <ins> <sub> <sup>.
